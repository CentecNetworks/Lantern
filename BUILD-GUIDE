           How to Build and Install VCOS And OVS Package
           =============================================

This document describes how to build and install Centec Openflow Switching System 
for hardware V330 52TX-RD.
it includes 1. How to build basic Virtual Centec Operating System (VCOS) image 
            2. How to install Debian Linux 
            3. How to build and install Open vSwitch(OVS) package

Build Requirements
------------------

To compile the VCOS distribution, you will need the following system and software:

    - Linux host 2.6.X (x86) (If you want to build Debian Linux system yourself,
      Ubuntu/Debian linux host is recommended)
    - A make program, eg. GNU make
    - The GNU Toolchain 4.7.3 (cross toolchain for MIPS)
        We have tested with Sourcery CodeBench Lite 2013.05-66.
        (https://sourcery.mentor.com/GNUToolchain/release2544)
        You may refer to Mentor Graphics (www.mentor.com) for more details.
    - Install the LZMA compression tool
        We have tested with lzma 4.32.7.
        (LZMA SDK which can be found from http://7-zip.org/sdk.html
         lzma command line tool was written by Ville Koskinen.  http://tukaani.org/lzma/)

Building the basic VCOS image
-----------------------------

Once you have prepared the required building host, software and Centec VCOS distribution,
you may follow the procedures below to build the 
basic Linux image:

1. Configure the building environment, run script: configure.sh under the source directory: 'system'

        % chmod +x ./configure.sh 
        % ./configure.sh -p /home/centec/mips/mips-2013.05
        
        Usage: ./configure.sh :
        -p path, specify absolute path for toolchain
        -g path, specify glibc path relative to the toolchain path (must be 32bit glibc, default is mips-linux-gnu/libc/lib)
        -c prefix, specify crosscompile prefix(default is mips-linux-gnu-)
        -j number, specify compile speed
        -d , _V330_DEBUG version
        
2. Run make in the top directory:

        % make
        or
        % make all

    On successful compilation, the final image will be named 'VCOS-1.0.bin', located in the 'out' directory.
    
Note:
    1. a pre-built image is prepared for user if you don't want to build the image yourself.
        The pre-built image is located in 'prebuilt/image/VCOS-1.0.bin"
    2. By default, the root account is created in the pre-built image:
    
    user name: root
    password : centec
    


Installing Debian Linux
------------------------------------

The Centec VCOS is able to boot from Debian Linux system rather than the basic Linux system,
 this gives user great flexibility to customize the switch operating system and able to 
 install/run your own software.
A prepared Debian Linux rootfs (created by tool 'debootstrap' based on Debian 7.2) 
is located in 'system/debian/rootfs.tar.gz' (Due to GitHub single file 100Mb limit, we put this
file to dropbox, you can download it from https://www.dropbox.com/s/rx8ex9lve2fmafd/rootfs.tar.gz), 
user need to untar the rootfs file into a USB storage (mounting on '/mnt/udisk' on the switch).

        % tar zxvf rootfs.tar.gz 
        
Note:
    1. The file system of USB storage must be in ext3 format.
    2. Files extracted from the rootfs file must be located in the root directory of USB storage.
    3. If you want to start the Debian Linux from USB storage on switch, you need
    to boot from basic Linux system first, and create a boot flag file 'debian_from_udisk' 
    in on-board flash (mounting on '/mnt/flash'), then reboot.
    eg.
        % touch /mnt/flash/debian_from_udisk
    
    Please refer to V330 52TX-RD hardware installation guide for details of 
    how to boot the system image.
             
    4. By default, we have created two accounts in the prepared Debian system package:

    user name: root
    password : centec
    
    user name: centec
    password : centec


Building and installing Open vSwitch(OVS) package
-------------------------------------------------

You may follow the procedures below to build Open vSwitch running on Debian system:

1. Configure the building environment, run script: configure.sh under the source directory: 'top'
    (You may skip this step if you have done it before)

        % chmod +x ./configure.sh 
        % ./configure.sh -p /home/centec/mips/mips-2013.05
        
        Usage: ./configure.sh :
        -p path, specify absolute path for toolchain
        -g path, specify glibc path relative to the toolchain path (must be 32bit glibc, default is mips-linux-gnu/libc/lib)
        -c prefix, specify crosscompile prefix(default is mips-linux-gnu-)
        -j number, specify compile speed
        -d , _V330_DEBUG version
        
2. Run make in the 'top' directory:

        % make ovs_package

    On successful compilation, the ovs package will be named 'open_vswitch.tar.gz',
    located in the 'out' directory.
      
3. To install the ovs package on Debian, you should copy the ovs package to the 
    switch and boot from Debian system, then:
    
        Untar the ovs package in switch:
        %  tar xzvf open_vswitch.tar.gz
        Get into the directory of extracted package:
        %  cd open_vswitch
        Run the installation script:
        %  ./install_ovs.sh
        
    On successful installation, the ovs tools will be installed in directory '/usr/local/openvswitch',
    and ovs will be run automatically on next boot.
